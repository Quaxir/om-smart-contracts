# Marketplace repository

This repo contains the code of the SMAUG markeptlace smart contracts, as well as a demo application (still incomplete) that manages the whole lifecycle of a test request: from creation to decision (including interledger triggering, if configured).

The `solidity` folder contains the code, test and instructions on how to setup and deploy the smart contracts. The `demo` folder contains the demo code.

Move into each folder for further instructions.
